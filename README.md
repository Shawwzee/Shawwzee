Hi I'm Shawn Sutton, an aspiting mobile and web developer looking to learn how to code, launch and maintain mobile-centric applications as well as websites for clients. At the moment I'm getting to grips with the basics and working up from there, this space is for the projects I complete and are happy to show off as part of my portfolio for development.
