Hi I'm Shawn Sutton, an aspiting mobile and web developer looking to learn how to code, launch and maintain mobile-centric applications as well as websites for clients. At the moment I'm getting to grips with the basics and working up from there, this space is for the projects I complete and are happy to show off as part of my portfolio for development.

If you have any questions or wanna contact me, you can message me on Twitter at www.twitter.com/theshawwzee and I'll get back to you as soon as I can, thanks you for your time!
